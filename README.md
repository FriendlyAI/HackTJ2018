> Good Financial Decisions are within your GRASP

## What is Grasp?

An app that helps keep track of your expenses by looking at 3 categories of spending:

- Needs: Rent, Insurance, Groceries etc.
- Goals : Car, vacation etc.
- Rainy Day Fund: The money left over that you save and use in case of an emergency such as surgery etc.

## Why is this important?

According to times magazine, more than 82% of Americans donâ€™t budget correctly which has resulted in very little cash reserves in case of an emergency.

This has in turn led to many people falling into debt or complete financial ruin incase that emergency does occur.

Our app is very important because it promotes healthy budgeting by making it very easy to classify your expenses and it is on your mobile device, making it easier to adjust budgets on the go.
